The gang interviews Matt on this episode, talking about all things React Server Components (RSCs), exploring their benefits, trade-offs, and adoption strategies. The hosts draw on their experiences at Wayfair, Fireworks, and Whoop to provide practical insights for learning and adopting RSCs.

### Why React Server Components

* **Benefits:**
  * Improved Time to First Byte (TTFB) via streaming.
  * More cohesive view of data dependencies (tighter front-end/back-end coupling).
  * Potential for smaller client-side bundles (automatic code splitting).

* **Trade-offs:**
  * Requires a server layer (which might be a new concept for some React developers).

### Migrating to React Server Components

* **Adoption Strategy:**
  * Start page by page (easiest entry point).
  * Flip the mental model: Start from the server and work towards the client.
  * Need to consider the bundler support for RSCs.
* **Challenges:**
  * You cannot easily swap out a small subsection of your page with an RSC.
  * Ensuring the bundler supports RSCs.
* **Key Considerations:**
  * Think about two environments: server and client.

### Understanding RSC Concepts

* **Two Environments:** The importance of understanding server (server components, server actions) and client (client components) environments when using RSCs. Front-end engineers new to server-side development need to be aware of security implications and potential caching issues.
* **Frameworks:** Highlighted the importance of understanding the core RSC principles separate from framework implementations like Next.js.
* **Not Necessarily Server Rendered:** Clarifying that client components can be server-rendered, avoiding the assumption that client components are solely client-side rendered.
* **Resources:** Blog post ["React for Two Computers" by Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/react-for-two-computers/) is a great resource to learn about the mental model. Also start to look at the other framework implementations to understand that there's next features and there are RSC features

### Standup Updates

* **Dillon:** Using a Dexcom continuous glucose monitor to manage blood sugar levels and migraines.
* **Scott:** Getting wedding suits, migrating from Datadog to Grafana monitors.
* **Matt:** Working on lyaml translation migration. Experimenting with Parcel's RSC integration and Redwood SDK.
