## Summary:

In this episode of the Bikeshed Podcast, the gang dives into their daily routine exploring their productivity habits and workflows. They also get down and dirty on discussing their spicy takes.

Daily Routines for Productivity

- Matt: Starts his day with a morning walk and uses Obsidian as a central hub for notes and task management. He reviews notes and Slack to identify action items. He also notes that he finds opportunities to make improvements on other things while doing a given task and acts on it instead of simply noting it.
- Scott: Begins with coffee, checks personal and work emails and Slack, reviews his calendar, and focuses with his headphones and vibes with music.. He uses Obsidian, Notion, or Notes to track tasks and goals, breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts. He also prioritizes clear communication and task articulation to minimize disruptions.
- Dillon: Prefers working from the office for increased productivity. He maps out his day with a "stand-up update" and clears his email and Slack to minimize distractions and enable focused work periods.

Follow-up on Daily Routines

- Matt and Scott both use end-of-day summaries to set the stage for the next day.
- Dillon prefers the office to WFH and does not perform an end-of-day summary and stated it's something he could work on.
- Matt uses an "outcomes" section in his daily notes to track accomplishments and artifacts, aiding in reviews and progress tracking over time.

Spicy Takes

- Dillon (Medium): React components often abuse props, violating the single responsibility principle due to a lack of care or education.
- Scott (Hot): Design systems should empathetically conform to user needs and not try to influence design in a specific direction. A bolder take was that design systems shouldn't exist at all.
- Matt (Hot Fire): We should not always assume good intent when reviewing code or understanding legacy systems. Sometimes, it's necessary to challenge decisions and consider alternative paths.

Two Takes and a Fake

The hosts played a round of "Two Takes and a Fake," a game where they presented three tech-related statements (two real, one fake) and challenged each other to identify the fabrication. Who will win? Tune in and find out!

What's New

- Scott: Been working with UI heavy work to animate webm video files on scroll. Check out the homepage of [Tollbit](https://tollbit.com/)
- Matt: Released [Vndr](https://github.com/hamlim/vndr/tree/main/packages/vndr), a CLI tool for vendoring (inlining) packages.
